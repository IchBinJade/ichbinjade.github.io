								<p>Hello World!</p> 
								<p>I've been working as a Software Engineer since early 2017 and enjoy teaching myself whatever I want to learn! Having dabbled with some VB in college, it wasn't until I began my career with <a href="https://www.travisperkinsplc.co.uk/">Travis Perkins</a> that I really started getting stuck into programming.</p>
								<p>I am also passionate about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the workplace and spend some of my free time helping plan and prepare the various activities that are delivered. When I'm not working, learning or planning, I enjoy taking my Japanese Akita for walks (enjoy it more when the weather is dry) and spending time with my fianc√©e.</p>
								<p>My current technology stack is:
									<ul>
										<li>UniVerse</li>
										<li>Jenkins (CI/CD)</li>
										<li>Git / Gitlab / Github</li>
										<li>Python</li>
										<li>MySQL</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Other skills and areas of knowledge include:
									<ul>
										<li>GSuite (including some Appscript)</li>
										<li>ServiceNow</li>
										<li>Confluence</li>
										<li>Jira</li>
										<li>Trello</li>
									</ul>

								<!--Software Engineer-->
								<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
								<h4>2018-present</h4>
								<p>Currently working using the DevOps model, balancing my time evenly between support and development, flexing where priorities may dictate otherwise. This includes providing 24/7 on-call support on a rotational basis.</p>
								<p>As well as designing and implementing software solutions and documentation, I also actively upskill and mentor more junior colleagues.</p>
								<!--App Support-->
								<h3>Application Support Analyst</h3>
								<h4>April 2016 - November 2018</h4>
								<p>Provided second and third line application support while investigating and identifying any bugs within code. This role gave the opportunity for, and introduction to, development of adhoc programs written to standards.</p>
								<p>Was also responsible for training/mentoring junior colleagues on the team once I'd reached an independent level, and sharing knowledge/skills and training to colleagues in the business.</p>
								<!--Senior SD-->
								<h3>Senior Service Desk Analyst</h3>
								<h4>Sep 2014 - April 2016</h4>
								<p>Promoted within six months, I managed my own team of analysts as well as working alongside the other seniors to help support theirs. While the main responsibilities of the analyst role was still present, there was more opportunity to build relationships with other business units to help deliver training, knowledge or operation-specific assistance.</p>
								<!--SD-->
								<h3>Service Desk Analyst</h3>
								<h4>Feb 2014 - Sep 2014</h4>
								<p>As my introductory role to IT, I was responsible for providing first line support via telephone and email. I was keen, even then, to help others and provide knowledge transfer as was made evident when I was chosen to visit the Group Sourcing team in China to provide on-site support for their transition to Google for Business</p>

								<h3>CLI Quote Database</a></h3>
								<p>Something fun to test my skills with after learning Python, and to help me store quotes that resonate with me during my study of the Philosophy of Stoicism!</p>
